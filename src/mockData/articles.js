    body: `“The traditional classical approach (or
        ideas)” is being proposed in this book as the name for the somewhat
        disparate ideas on the macrostructure of the economy from the middle
        of the eighteenth century to the publication of Keynes’s The General
        Theory in 1936. To quite a considerable extent, these ideas were
        diffuse, varied among authors and changed over time. In any case,
        there was no single compact version of the overall exposition, though
        the profession, following Keynes, now treats them as if there was a
        compact model. We will call this compact statement of the traditional
        classical ideas the traditional classical model. It was never stated
        as a compact model even during its heyday during the nineteenth and
        early twentieth centuries, but its ideas permeate the classical
        paradigm. The two components of the traditional classical model
        directly relevant to monetary economics were the quantity theory for
        the determination of prices (see Chapter 2) and the loanable funds
        theory for the determination of interest rates (see Chapter 19).`,

      theory of employment was the analysis of the labor market and
      incorporated the assumption of equilibrium, which state represents
      full employment, so that the traditional classical set of ideas did
      not possess a theory of unemployment or of variations in aggregate
      employment other than those of variations in their long-run levels.
      Hence, it did not possess a theory of the deviations in unemployment
      and output from their full-employment levels. However, another
      component of the traditional classical ideas was its business cycle
      explanations, which allowed for fluctuations in economic activity in
      the economy’s response to real or monetary shocks, so that such
      explanations implicitly did envisage deviations from full employment.
      The traditional classical approach lacked the integration of its
      microeconomic-based theory of employment and output with its business
      cycle explanations, as well as of their mix with the quantity theory
      and the loanable funds theory. To sum up, while this approach had many
      of the components of macroeconomics, it lacked an integrated
      macroeconomic framework. It also lacked an explicit treatment of the
      aggregate demand for commodities, now encompassed in the IS
      relationship, which is an essential building block of current
      macroeconomics.`,
